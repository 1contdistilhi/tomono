## Converting PDF files to editable Office formats
 
One of the main features of ABBYY PDF Transformer 3.0 is its ability to convert PDF files to editable Office formats, such as DOCX, XLSX and PPTX. This can be very useful if you need to edit or reuse the content of a PDF file in an Office application.
 
To convert a PDF file to an Office format, follow these steps:

1. Open ABBYY PDF Transformer 3.0 and click on the "Open" button to select the PDF file you want to convert.
2. Choose the output format from the drop-down menu at the top. You can choose between Word, Excel, PowerPoint or RTF.
3. Click on the "Convert" button and wait for the conversion process to finish.
4. Open the converted file in your preferred Office application and make any changes you need.

You can also convert multiple PDF files at once by using the "Batch Conversion" mode. To do this, click on the "Batch Conversion" button at the bottom of the main window and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
## Creating PDF files from Office documents
 
Another feature of ABBYY PDF Transformer 3.0 is its ability to create PDF files from Office documents. This can be very useful if you need to share or archive your documents in a universal and secure format.

You can also create a PDF file from multiple Office documents by using the "Combine Files into One PDF" option from the same menu. To do this, select the documents you want to combine and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
## Editing PDF files in Office applications
 
A third feature of ABBYY PDF Transformer 3.0 is its ability to edit PDF files in Office applications. This can be very useful if you need to make minor changes or corrections to a PDF file without converting it to another format.
 
To edit a PDF file in an Office application, follow these steps:

1. Open ABBYY PDF Transformer 3.0 and click on the "Open" button to select the PDF file you want to edit.
2. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the main window.

4. The selected Office application will open with your PDF file loaded as an editable document.
5. Make any changes you need and save your document as a new PDF file or overwrite the original one.

Note that this feature only works for simple PDF files that contain text and images. If your PDF file contains complex elements, such as tables, charts or forms, you may need to convert it to an Office format first before editing it.
